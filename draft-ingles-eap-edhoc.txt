Abstract

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
   provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication
   methods.  This document specifies the use of EAP-EDHOC with Ephemeral
   Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC).  EDHOC provides a very compact and
   lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange with ephemeral
   keys, using COSE (RFC 8152) to provide security services efficiently
   encoded in CBOR [RFC8949].  This document also provides guidance on
   authentication and authorization for EAP-EDHOC.

1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in [RFC3748],
   provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication
   methods.  This document specifies the EAP authentication method EAP-
   EDHOC which uses COSE defined credential-based mutual authentication,
   utilising the EDHOC protocol cipher suite negotiation and
   establishment of shared secret keying material.  Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC, [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]) is a lightweight
   authenticated key exchange protocol designed for highly constrained
   settings.  The main objective for EDHOC is to be a lightweight
   authenticated key exchange for OSCORE [RFC8613], i.e., to provide
   authentication and session key establishment for IoT use cases such
   as those built on CoAP [RFC7252] involving 'things' with embedded
   microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.  EDHOC reuses the same
   lightweight primitives as OSCORE, CBOR [RFC8949] and COSE [RFC8152],
   and specifies the use of CoAP but is not bound to a particular
   transport.  The EAP-EDHOC method will enable the integration of EDHOC
   in different applications and use cases making use of the EAP
   framework.

[Editor's note: Though part of this abstract is coming from EAP-TLS I think we could rewrite it a little bit or add some information.]

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

3.1.  Overview of the EAP-EDHOC Conversation

   The EDHOC protocol consists of three mandatory messages (message_1,
   message_2, message_3) an optional message_4, between Initiator and
   Responder, and an error message.

   After receiving an EAP-Request packet with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC as
   described in this document, the conversation will continue with the
   EDHOC protocol encapsulated in the data fields of EAP-Response and
   EAP-Request packets.  When EAP-EDHOC is used, the formatting and
   processing of the EDHOC message SHALL be done as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].  This document only lists additional and
   different requirements, restrictions, and processing compared to
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

3.1.1.  Authentication

   EAP-EDHOC authentication credentials can be of any type supported by
   COSE and be transported or referenced by EDHOC.

   EAP-EDHOC provides forward secrecy by exchange of ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman public keys in message_1 and message_2.

   The optimization combining the execution of EDHOC with the first
   subsequent OSCORE transaction specified in
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] is not supported in this EAP method.

[Editor's note: I think this is something that could be considered in the future, making EAP-EDHOC a tunnelled EAP method]

   Figure 1 shows an example message flow for a successful EAP-EDHOC.

3.1.2.  Transport and Message Correlation

   EDHOC is not bound to a particular transport layer and can even be
   used in environments without IP.  Nonetheless, EDHOC specification
   has a set of requirements for its transport protocol
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].  These include handling message loss,
   reordering, duplication, fragmentation, demultiplex EDHOC messages
   from other types of messages, denial-of-service protection, and
   message correlation.

   The EAP protocol manages the exchange of messages guaranteeing the
   order of transmission.  In the same way, it manages retransmissions
   and the detection of duplicate messages.  Therefore, EAP ensures the
   message correlation mechanism in the different EAP layers so there is
   no need to use connection identifiers for EDHOC message correlation,
   as described in Section 3.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

[Editor's note: I'd add some more details per each of the requirements. E.g. Impliclity you mention handling message loss this is solved with retransmissions I would make it explicit. Which are the correlation mechanism and where it happens and how. How about, demultiplex EDHOC message or fragmentation]

   There are other requisites that are fulfilled by the EAP lower
   layers, as specified in {RFC3748}. These include ordering guarantees
   and error detection.

3.1.3.  Termination

   Editor's note: Fix the text and figures below.

   If the EAP-EDHOC peer authenticates successfully, the EAP-EDHOC
   server MUST send an EAP-Request packet with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC
   containing EDHOC messages.

[Editor's note: I agree this text is weird. I'd say this is to refer when the EAP-EDHOC is processed correctly. I think it is referring if the EDHOC message is also authenticated properly]

   The message flow ends with a protected success indication from the
   EAP-EDHOC server, followed by an EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type=EAP-
   EDHOC and no data from the EAP-EDHOC peer, followed by EAP-Success
   from the server.

   If the EAP-EDHOC server authenticates successfully, the EAP-EDHOC
   peer MUST send an EAP-Response message with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC
   containing EDHOC messages conforming to the EDHOC document
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

   Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate message flows in several
   cases where the EAP-EDHOC peer or EAP-EDHOC server sends a EDHOC
   error message.

   Figure 2 shows an example message flow where the EAP-EDHOC server
   rejects message_1 with an EDHOC error message.

3.1.4.  Identity

   It is RECOMMENDED to use anonymous NAIs RFC7542 in the Identity
   Response as such identities are routable and privacy-friendly.

   While opaque blobs are allowed by [RFC3748], such identities are NOT
   RECOMMENDED as they are not routable and should only be considered in
   local deployments where the EAP-EDHOC peer, EAP authenticator, and
   EAP-EDHOC server all belong to the same network.

   Many client certificates contain an identity such as an email
   address, which is already in NAI format.  When the client certificate
   contains an NAI as subject name or alternative subject name, an
   anonymous NAI SHOULD be derived from the NAI in the certificate; See
   section Section 3.1.5.

3.1.5.  Privacy

   EAP-EDHOC peer and server implementations supporting EAP-EDHOC MUST
   support anonymous Network Access Identifiers (NAIs) (Section 2.4 of
   RFC7542).  [Editor's note this reference should be included] A client
   supporting EAP-EDHOC MUST NOT send its username (or any other
   permanent identifiers) in cleartext in the Identity Response (or any
   message used instead of the Identity Response).  Following [RFC7542],
   it is RECOMMENDED to omit the username (i.e., the NAI is @realm), but
   other constructions such as a fixed username (e.g., anonymous@realm)
   or an encrypted username (e.g.,
   xCZINCPTK5+7y81CrSYbPg+RKPE3OTrYLn4AQc4AC2U=@realm) are allowed.
   Note that the NAI MUST be a UTF-8 string as defined by the grammar in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC7542].

   EAP-EDHOC is always used with privacy.  This does not add any extra
   round trips and the message flow with privacy is just the normal
   message flow as shown in Figure 1.

3.1.6.  Fragmentation

   Editor's note: fill in this section

   EAP-EDHOC provides fragmentation support.  To do so, the EAP request
   and response messages of EAP-EDHOC have a set of information fields
   that allow for the specification of the fragmentation process (See
   section Section 4 for the detailed description).  Of these fields, we
   will highlight one that contains a set of flags, that steer the
   fragmentation process.  If the L bit is set, we are specifying that
   the next message will be fragmented and that in such a message we can
   also find the length of the message.

   EAP-EDHOC fragmentation support is provided through addition of a
   flags octet within the EAP-Response and EAP-Request packets, as well
   as a (conditional) EAP-EDHOC Message Length field of four octets.

   [Editor's note: At this point, flags have not been explained]

   Implementations MUST NOT set the L bit in unfragmented messages, but
   they MUST accept unfragmented messages with and without the L bit
   set.  Some EAP implementations and access networks may limit the
   number of EAP packet exchanges that can be handled.  To avoid
   fragmentation, it is RECOMMENDED to keep the sizes of EAP-EDHOC peer,
   EAP-EDHOC server, and trust anchor authentication credentials small
   and the length of the certificate chains short.  In addition, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use mechanisms that reduce the sizes of Certificate
   messages.

   EDHOC is designed to perform well in constrained networks where
   message sizes are restricted for performance reasons.  However,
   except for message_2, which by construction has an upper bound
   limited by a multiple of the hash function output, there are no
   specific message size limitations.  With SHA-256 as hash function,
   message_2 cannot be longer than 8160 octets.  The other three EAP-
   EDHOC messages do not have an upper bound.  Furthermore, in the case
   of sending a certificate in a message instead of a reference, a
   certificate may in principle be as long as 16 MB.  Hence, the EAP-
   EDHOC messages sent in a single round may thus be larger than the MTU
   size or the maximum Remote Authentication Dail-In User Service
   (RADIUS) packet size of 4096 octets.  As a result, an EAP-EDHOC
   implementation MUST provide its own support for fragmentation and
   reassembly.

   Since EAP is a simple ACK-NAK protocol, fragmentation support can be
   added in a simple manner.  In EAP, fragments that are lost or damaged
   in transit will be retransmitted, and since sequencing information is
   provided by the Identifier field in EAP, there is no need for a
   fragment offset field as is provided in IPv4 EAP-EDHOC fragmentation
   support is provided through the addition of a flags octet within the
   EAP-Response and EAP-Request packets, as well as a EDHOC Message
   Length field of four octets.  Flags include the Length included (L),
   More fragments (M), and EAP-EDHOC Start (S) bits.  The L flag is set
   to indicate the presence of the four-octet EDHOC Message Length
   field, and MUST be set for the first fragment of a fragmented EDHOC
   message or set of messages.  The M flag is set on all but the last
   fragment.  The S flag is set only within the EAP-EDHOC start message
   sent from the EAP server to the peer.  The EDHOC Message Length field
   is four octets, and provides the total length of the EDHOC message or
   set of messages that is being fragmented; this simplifies buffer
   allocation.

   When an EAP-EDHOC peer receives an EAP-Request packet with the M bit
   set, it MUST respond with an EAP-Response with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC and
   no data.  This serves as a fragment ACK.  The EAP server MUST wait
   until it receives the EAP-Response before sending another fragment.
   In order to prevent errors in the processing of fragments, the EAP
   server MUST increment the Identifier field for each fragment
   contained within an EAP-Request, and the peer MUST include this
   Identifier value in the fragment ACK contained within the EAP-
   Response.  Retransmitted fragments will contain the same Identifier
   value.

   Similarly, when the EAP server receives an EAP-Response with the M
   bit set, it MUST respond with an EAP-Request with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC
   and no data.  This serves as a fragment ACK.  The EAP peer MUST wait
   until it receives the EAP-Request before sending another fragment.
   In order to prevent errors in the processing of fragments, the EAP
   server MUST increment the Identifier value for each fragment ACK
   contained within an EAP-Request, and the peer MUST include this
   Identifier value in the subsequent fragment contained within an EAP-
   Response.

   In the case where the EAP-EDHOC mutual authentication is successful,
   and fragmentation is required, the conversation will appear as
   follows:

3.2.  Identity Verification

   Editor's note: fill in this section

   The EAP peer identity provided in the EAP-Response/Identity is not
   authenticated by EAP-EDHOC.  Unauthenticated information MUST NOT be
   used for authorization.  The authenticator and the EAP-EDHOC server
   MAY examine the identity presented in EAP-Response/Identity for
   purposes such as routing and EAP method selection.  EAP-EDHOC servers
   MAY reject conversations if the identity does not match their policy.

   The EAP peer identity provided in the EAP-Response/Identity is not
   authenticated by EAP-EDHOC.  Unauthenticated information MUST NOT be
   used for accounting purposes or to give authorization.  The
   authenticator and the EAP-EDHOC server MAY examine the identity
   presented in EAP-Response/Identity for purposes such as routing and
   EAP method selection.  EAP-EDHOC servers MAY reject conversations if
   the identity does not match their policy.  Note that this also
   applies to resumption; see Sections 2.1.3, 5.6, and 5.7.The EAP
   server identity in the EDHOC server certificate is typically a fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN) in the SubjectAltName (SAN) extension.
   Since EAP-EDHOC deployments may use more than one EAP server, each
   with a different certificate, EAP peer implementations SHOULD allow
   for the configuration of one or more trusted root certificates (CA
   certificate) to authenticate the server certificate and one or more
   server names to match against the SubjectAltName (SAN) extension in
   the server certificate.  If any of the configured names match any of
   the names in the SAN extension, then the name check passes.  To
   simplify name matching, an EAP-EDHOC deployment can assign a name to
   represent an authorized EAP server and EAP Server certificates can
   include this name in the list of SANs for each certificate that
   represents an EAP-EDHOC server.  If server name matching is not used,
   then it degrades the confidence that the EAP server with which it is
   interacting is authoritative for the given network.  If name matching
   is not used with a public root CA, then effectively any server can
   obtain a certificate that will be trusted for EAP authentication by
   the peer.  While this guide to verify domain names is new and was not
   mentioned in [RFC5216], it has been widely implemented in EAP-EDHOC
   peers.  As such, it is believed that this section contains minimal
   new interoperability or implementation requirements on EAP-EDHOC
   peers and can be applied to earlier versions of EDHOC.  The process
   of configuring a root CA certificate and a server name is non-
   trivial; therefore, automated methods of provisioning are
   RECOMMENDED.  For example, the eduroam federation [RFC7593] provides
   a Configuration Assistant Tool (CAT) to automate the configuration
   process.  In the absence of a trusted root CA certificate (user-
   configured or system-wide), EAP peers MAY implement a trust on first
   use (TOFU) mechanism where the peer trusts and stores the server
   certificate during the first connection attempt.  The EAP peer
   ensures that the server presents the same stored certificate on
   subsequent interactions.  The use of a TOFU mechanism does not allow
   for the server certificate to change without out-of-band validation
   of the certificate and is therefore not suitable for many deployments
   including ones where multiple EAP servers are deployed for high
   availability.  TOFU mechanisms increase the susceptibility to traffic
   interception attacks and should only be used if there are adequate
   controls in place to mitigate this risk.

3.3.  Key Hierarchy

   Editor's note: fill in this section

   The key schedule for EDHOC is described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].  The Key_Material and Method-Id SHALL be
   derived from the PRK_exporter using the EDHOC-Exporter interface, see
   Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

   Type is the value of the EAP Type field defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC3748].  For EAP-EDHOC, the Type field has the value TBD1.

   Type        =  TBD1
   MSK         =  EDHOC-Exporter(TBD2 ,Type, 64)
   EMSK        =  EDHOC-Exporter(TBD3 ,Type, 64)
   Method-Id   =  EDHOC-Exporter(TBD4, Type, 64)
   Session-Id  =  Type || Method-Id

   EAP-EDHOC exports the MSK and does not specify how it is used by
   lower layers.

3.4.  Parameter Negotiation and Compliance Requirements

   The EAP-EDHOC peers and EAP-EDHOC servers MUST comply with the
   compliance requirements (mandatory-to-implement cipher suites,
   signature algorithms, key exchange algorithms, extensions, etc.)
   defined in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

3.5.  EAP State Machines

   The EAP-EDHOC server sends message_4 in an EAP-Request as a protected
   success result indication.

   EDHOC error messages SHOULD be considered failure result indication,
   as defined in [RFC3748].  After sending or receiving an EDHOC error
   message, the EAP-EDHOC server may only send an EAP-Failure.  EDHOC
   error messages are unprotected.

   The keying material can be derived after message_3 has been sent or
   received.  Implementations following [RFC4137] can then set the
   eapKeyData and aaaEapKeyData variables ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [AP:
   More accurate description on when each party can derive the key
   material] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The keying material can be made available to lower layers and the
   authenticator after the authenticated success result indication has
   been sent or received.  Implementations following [RFC4137] can set
   the eapKeyAvailable and aaaEapKeyAvailable variables.

   Code

     1   Identifier

     The Identifier field is one octet and aids in matching responses
     with requests.  The Identifier field MUST be changed on each
     Request packet.

   Length

     The Length field is two octets and indicates the length of the EAP
     packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Type, and Data
     fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field should be
     treated as Data Link Layer padding and MUST be ignored on
     reception.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     L = Length included
     M = More fragments
     S = EAP-EDHOC start
     R = Reserved

     The L bit (length included) is set to indicate the presence of the
     four-octet EDHOC Message Length field and MUST be set for the first
     fragment of a fragmented EDHOC message or set of messages.  The M
     bit (more fragments) is set on all but the last fragment.  The S
     bit (EAP-EDHOC start) is set in an EAP-EDHOC Start message.  This
     differentiates the EAP-EDHOC Start message from a fragment
     acknowledgement.  Implementations of this specification MUST set
     the reserved bits to zero and MUST ignore them on reception.

   EDHOC Message Length

     The EDHOC Message Length field is four octets and is present only
     if the L bit is set.  This field provides the total length of the
     EDHOC message or set of messages that is being fragmented.

   EDHOC data

     The EDHOC data consists of the encapsulated EDHOC packet in EDHOC
     message format.

     fragment of a fragmented EDHOC message or set of messages.  The M
     bit (more fragments) is set on all but the last fragment.
     Implementations of this specification MUST set the reserved bits
     to zero and MUST ignore them on reception.

   EDHOC Message Length

     The EDHOC Message Length field is four octets and is present only
     if the L bit is set.  This field provides the total length of the
     EDHOC message or set of messages that is being fragmented.

   EDHOC data

     The EDHOC data consists of the encapsulated EDHOC message.
