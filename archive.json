Since EAD_3 and EAD_4 are good places to exchange the channel binding protection. \n\nIt is also mentioned that \"... after\n   sending a protected indication of failed consistency, the EAP server MUST send an EAP-Failure message to terminate the session.\" That happens with in EAD_4 , the EAP peer will answer with the typical empty EAP-EDHOC message and the EAP server will give an EAP-Failure.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be easier to provide something as EAP-GPSK does in section 12.3 by saying that EAP-EDHOC provides a way of transporting channel binding information in EAD_3 and EAD_4 using a bit string , we define a new ead label but we do not define anything else.
